The mutable storage class in C++:
The mutable storage class is a property that gives you access to modify the non-static data members (not static data members) of a class, even when the object is declared as constant.
This is mainly useful for scenarios where the data needs modification without affecting the logical state of the object, like caching, lazy initialization, and logging.
